## Challenges

1. Navigate to your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository folder.
1. Create a new branch for today's challenge called `for-each`
   - `git checkout -b for-each`
1. Retrieve the code challenge from the system
   - `npm run get-challenge 01`
1. In your terminal, from your `data-structures-and-algorithms` folder, run `npm test 01` to execute the tests in this file for **today's challenge.**
   - At this point you will see the failed tests scroll through your terminal window with a brief report of the number of failed tests at the bottom.
   - If you do not see this, verify your installation of Jest by typing `npx jest --version` in your terminal. Filename typos can make things break!
1. Write code to make the tests pass, one at a time. Let the error messages guide you.
1. Once the test is passing, refactor as needed, then move on to the next challenge.

> *Note, you can also run `npm test` (without a challenge number) to run all of the tests for every code challenge file assignment during the course all at once. This can get "noisy", but it's an opportunity to get a view of your overall progress*

## Submission

When you have completed the entire set of code challenges and all tests pass, create a pull request from your current branch to the master branch and merge it into master.

You will be able to see a test coverage report in **GitHub** on the **Actions** tab of your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository. It should match what you saw on your terminal in the above steps. Your graders will be looking at this as well.

Submit a link to your pull request.
