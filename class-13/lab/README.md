  - [13-details.png](../../class-11/wireframes/13-details.png)  
  - [13-update.png](../../class-11/wireframes/13-update.png)
- Also refer to wireframes from [lab 11](../../class-11/lab)
- Also refer to wireframes from [lab 12](../../class-12/lab)

## Configuration

_Your repository must include the following config files:_

- `.env` - with your PORT and DATABASE_URL. Make sure this file is included in your `.gitignore`
- `README.md` - with documentation regarding your lab and it's current state of development. Check the "documentation" section below for more details on how that should look **AT MINIMUM**
- `.gitignore` - with standard NodeJS configurations
- `.eslintrc.json` - with Code 301 course standards for the linter
- `package.json` - with all dependencies and any associated details related to configuration. Note that you will be adding a new package today called `method-override`.
- Note that the `package-lock.json` file is automatically created when dependencies are installed and ensures that future installations of the project use the same versions of the dependencies.
Use the following as a guide for your directory structure.

## User Stories and Feature Tasks

### Overview

Today's features include the ability to update or delete a book from the collection. These events can be triggered from the detail view of a single book.

### Time Estimate

For each of the features listed below, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

```
Number and name of feature: ________________________________

Estimate of time needed to complete: _____

Start time: _____

Finish time: _____

Actual time needed to complete: _____
```

Add this information to your README.

### Feature Tasks

See the Trello board for your feature tasks for today's lab.

_Your `README.md` must include:_

```md

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.

## Credits and Collaborations
